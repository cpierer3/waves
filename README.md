# Wave Propagation with PML Methods



This repository contains the numerical implementations and code examples for the methods presented in the accompanying bachelor thesis PDF document. The notebooks provide practical demonstrations of the theoretical concepts developed in the thesis, offering hands-on examples of Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) techniques for wave scattering problems.
